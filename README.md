# Frontend Tidbits

A curated collection of small, focused front-end code snippets — exploring modern CSS, JavaScript, React, and UI interaction patterns.

This repository is intentionally lightweight. Each “tidbit” isolates a single idea or technique without the overhead of a full project.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Modern CSS patterns (layout, masking, animation, variables)
- JavaScript interaction techniques
- React component experiments
- UI and UX interaction ideas
- Small explorations that don’t belong in large demos

Each folder contains a self-contained snippet with minimal setup.
